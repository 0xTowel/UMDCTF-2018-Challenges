# Scary Bin
My flag is kept in this binary, but it is too scary for me to reverse!
Can you help me out and get my flag? I was told it's not actually that scary, but I don't believe it...

N.B.: I orginally created this challenge with a different intended solution using a very specific technique. After some consideration, I realized it would be too difficult for the CTF and changed it an easier technique. I forgot to change the flag however, so don't worry if the flag doesn't make sense -- it is referencing the old intended technique which was removed.
